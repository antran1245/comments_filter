# Objective

Use **ChatGPT** to filter out comments that contain just emoticons words or emojis and comments that are responsive, text, verbal, written, and remarks.

*Alternative: Could use a map/array of emoticons and filter out the comments using the map/array.*

Examples of Emoticons Comment:
- lol
- lmao
- üòÄ
- Congrats :)

## Run

`yarn start` or `npm start`

## Packages

- TypeScript

## Problems

- Handling a large a database of comments.
  - Keeping a database of all the processed comments by giving each comment object with boolean value of emoticon or not.
- Getting a more accuracy result when process the comments.
